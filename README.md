## 📊 **Data Flow Architecture**


I've outlined a comprehensive workflow for health data management, detailing how information flows through machine learning models and user insights generation. The data pipeline ensures secure processing, from initial collection through advanced predictive modeling to personalized user recommendations. Key stages include symptom input, feature exploration, model training, and intelligent algorithmic suggestions that provide clinical-grade insights.

The system architects a multi-layered approach to health intelligence, integrating cutting-edge technologies to transform raw health data into actionable, personalized wellness strategies.

Advanced notification mechanisms enable proactive health monitoring, empowering users with predictive recommendations and timely intervention strategies. The notification framework adapts to individual health profiles, delivering context-specific alerts that prioritize user safety and wellness.

Intelligent thresholding dynamically adjusts alert sensitivities based on individual health patterns, ensuring that critical health insights are communicated promptly and preventatively.
